## Sessions I wish I'd Attended, Slides Reviewed in Retrospect

### What Does It Take for an Organization to Make Difficult Information-Based Decisions? Using the Oregon Department of Forestry’s RipStream Project as a Case Study *[Jeremy Groom](http://www.groomanalytics.com/who-we-are.html), Groom Analytics*

Problem: if data suggests a course of action vested interests don't want to take, how can it still be taken?

Heard this session was one of the most interactive of the conference. He discussed a case where data implied a hard decision needed to be made, with a lot of stakeholders on both sides. His process of handling these situations sounds nuanced and he shares a lot of lessons learned from this work. I especially like his advice for working with stakeholders: 
* Individuals matter
* Frequent communication + transparency + fairness = trust
* Getting feedback before analyses may increase buy-in
* Setting groundwork for next project

Some other useful reminders to me anyway:
* Small successes help with morale
* Shield tech staff from politics 
* Courage to have difficult conversations
* Provide room to fail, suspend disbelief
* Own the findings
* Retain dedicated staff
* Decision-makers want decision space (Bite-sized decisions)


I like this simple layout of costs and benefits of action and no action - takes some of the emotion out of it and lays all cards on the table.
