title: No evidence hours of sleep associated with calories eaten next day (p = 0.241)
category: R
tags: R
---

I wanted to know if days I'm running on less sleep, I eat more to make up for it. Fortunately I have FitBit data. Bottom line up front: I found no association between hours of sleep the night before and calories recorded the next day. A lot of asumptions were made to get there, but nothing was emerging so I don't think I'll check if the assumptions caused the result.

Fitbit data currently can be downloaded from [one's user account](https://www.fitbit.com/export/user/data). This is limited to daily level data, and downloads of a month at a time. I reccomend the .xls format for easier processing in R.

These download as the date of export so I renamed them to each month

So here I've got six months of data. Now, my key starting hypothesis is my daily calorie consumption depends on my hours of sleep the night before. In particular, I expect a negative association - the less I slept, the more I ate.

So I'm going to need a handful of packages to efficiently get to this answer and pursue my sub-queries along the way. These packages, to be specific:
```r
require(tidyverse)
require(readxl)
require(lubridate)
require(ggthemes)
require(stringr)
require(purrr)
```

### December Data

Once these suckers are loaded, I can explore December, my most recent month. Note Calories has a comma, so needs to be converted to a number. Similarly, Date needs to be converted to a date.
```r
December_foods <- read_excel(
  path = "C:/Users/Dan/Documents/R/FitBit/fitbit_export_201712.xls",
  sheet = "Foods")

# doesn't see Calories as a number
glimpse(December_foods)
# both are characters
December_foods$Date <- ymd(December_foods$Date)
December_foods$`Calories In` <-  
  as.numeric(gsub(",", "", December_foods$`Calories In`))

ggplot(December_foods, aes(x = Date, y = `Calories In`)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  labs(title = "Calories vs. Date")
```
![Dec C v. D 1](/images/fitbit03.png "Dec C v. D 1")

Wow! I've really gone on a diet in late December! My self-discpline is awesome! 
Oh, wait... I see some zeros. And I know I wasn't fasting all of those days. In fact, I happen to know I just didn't record calories some days and usually those non-record days are above average calorie days, if anything. So I can't just impute with the median or mean - I'd bet 2500 is a fair guess. That might be a charitable gift to myself around Christmas given how many calories I bet I actually consumed... In fact the day below 1000 calories is also probably fair to set at 2500 too. So let's fix those and replot.

```r
assumed_calories_on_blank_days <- 2500
December_foods$`Calories In`[December_foods$`Calories In` <= 1000] <- 
  assumed_calories_on_blank_days

ggplot(December_foods, aes(x = Date, y = `Calories In`)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  labs(title = "Calories vs. Date With Imputed Zeros")
```
![Dec C v. D 2](/images/fitbit04.png "Dec C v. D 2")
A less impressive decrease in calories. Let's take a look at a boxplot.

```r
ggplot(December_foods, aes(x = 1, y = `Calories In`)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  labs(title = "Calories in December With Imputed Zeros") +
  coord_flip()
```
![Dec C v. D 3](/images/fitbit05.png "Dec C v. D 3")
The median's actually kind of high (gasp!). The range looks beleiveable based on my memory of the month - I mean it's December. Let's check out a histogram

```r
ggplot(December_foods, aes(x = `Calories In`)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100) +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  labs(title = "Calories in December With Imputed Zeros")
```
![Dec C v. D 4](/images/fitbit06.png "Dec C v. D 4")
This actually doesn't look too normal.

### Let's pull in all six months now
To reduce keystrokes, can use `r map` from `r purrr` library to get them all into one data object.
```r
7:12 %>% as.character() %>% str_pad(2, pad = "0") -> data_months
files_to_load <- paste0("C:/Users/Dan/Documents/R/FitBit/fitbit_export_2017" 
                        , data_months, ".xls")
glimpse(files_to_load)

foods <- map(files_to_load, read_excel, sheet = "Foods")

glimpse(foods)
# we have a list of 6 tables, let's combine them all

foods <- bind_rows(foods)
glimpse(foods)
 
# OK have to process same as before
foods$Date <- ymd(foods$Date)
foods$`Calories In` <-  
  as.numeric(gsub(",", "", foods$`Calories In`))

# how many zero days are there this time?
ggplot(foods, aes(x = Date, y = `Calories In`)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  labs(title = "Calories vs. Date")
```
![Jun-Dec C v. D 1](/images/fitbit07.png "Jun-Dec C v. D 1")
How many zeros are there? Seem to be a lot of zeros. 

```r
foods %>% 
  mutate(data_month = month(Date, label = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(data_month) %>%
  summarize(zero_days = sum(`Calories In` == 0))
```
![Jun-Dec C v. D 2](/images/fitbit08.png "Jun-Dec C v. D 2")
So we have a little problem here. Apparently in August and September I took a break from counting calories. November doesn't look that complete either. I think July, August and December we can do something with, but time series analysis is looking less plausible. I'll take just those three months and impute everything 1200 calories or fewer to 2500.

```r
foods %>% 
  mutate(data_month = month(Date, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  filter(data_month %in% c("Jul", "Oct", "Dec")) ->
  foods_full_months

assumed_calories_on_blank_days <- 2500
foods_full_months$`Calories In`[foods_full_months$`Calories In` <= 1000] <- 
  assumed_calories_on_blank_days

# replot
ggplot(foods_full_months, aes(x = Date, y = `Calories In`)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  labs(title = "Calories vs. Date With Imputed Zeros")
```
![Jun-Dec C v. D 3](/images/fitbit09.png "Jun-Dec C v. D 3")
Sigh, less impressive a decrease in calories. Let's see the boxplot to get a sense of distribution.

```r
ggplot(foods_full_months, aes(x = 1, y = `Calories In`)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  labs(title = "Calories With Imputed Zeros") +
  coord_flip()
```
![Jun-Dec C v. D 4](/images/fitbit10.png "Jun-Dec C v. D 4")
Quite a bit of bunching near 2500, the imputed value on my missing days. Histogram...
