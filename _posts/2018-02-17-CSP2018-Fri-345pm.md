## 3:45 PM Working with Health Care Data

### Application of Support Vector Machine Modeling and Graph Theory Metrics for Disease Classification *Jessica Michelle Rudd, Kennesaw State University*

Problem: Diseases tend to occur in related populations, but disease prediction classificiation tasks usually ignore this information.

She took an SVM model, the favorite of some people it seems, and added some relationship modelling with graph theory to improve prediction accuracy. She took on two prediction tasks: Diabetes undiagnosed or diagnosed vs no DM, and undiagnosed DM and pre-diabetes vs. no diabetes. It used 14 typical variables from NHANES, and does reasonably well with test set AUCs around 0.83 and 0.73 respectively. 

Her big issue with using graph theory to model connections among people was lack of available data. She simulated the data using a Watts-Strogatz small world netrwork model to create a simplified network. She used iGraph package in R. The models didn't turn out that great in terms of AUC, around 0.65. 

In a behavioral risk factor prediction task, actually if you look at the testing set I'd say logisitc regression looked like it handled the social network information better perhaps because it was simulated, so not informative.

She mentioned a [Google arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07860.pdf) on ICD9 code discharge prediction that applied deep learning on FHIR data to predict all discharge ICD codes at an AUC of 0.90. I don't know how hard that task is, but some of the other tasks apparently they did better than insustry standard at least. I think it's interesting - in theory the right format of EHR data should be very informative. But they're missing claims - and that could be the thing that makes the difference.
