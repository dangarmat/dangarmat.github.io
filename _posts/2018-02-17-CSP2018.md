Highlights from [Conference on Statistical Practice](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/csp/2018/index.cfm) sessions I attended. To keep it simple just a few notes and my favorite slide per session.

### Statistical Methods for National Security Risk Quantification and Optimal Resource Allocation, *Robert Brigantic, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory*

Problem: multiple cobinations of risk points and danger situations, how do we best allocate resources to reduce risk? Can we do this intelligently based on data and logic, to supplement expert intuition? 

Pacific Northwest National Lab attempted to solve this problem by quantifying risk. They break it down into quantifiable sub-problems. The final equation, I thought was a nice way to represent it: $R = (f(C,V,T))$.
