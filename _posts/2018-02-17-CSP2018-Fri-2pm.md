## 2:00 PM Data Mining Algorithms / Presenting and Storytelling 

### Stochastic Gradient Boosting on Distributed Data *Roxy Cramer, Rogue Wave Software*

Problem: iterative algorithms like Gradient Boosting Trees and Generalized Regression can't be run on distributed computing efficiently.

She does solve some of the problem by an approximate method that is useful at least to see if gradient boosted trees are worth pursuing for the question before spending the computing power to fully train a model. The algorithm performed well on the UCI Mushroom dataset that has two classes, edible or poisonous, but not on the UCI Covertype dataset that had multiple classes. It has some advantage when there is more predictability.

I think it basically is an implementation of MapReduce on an algorithm not designed to do that, and the results are OK, but not groundbreaking. Basically it looks to me like it would only work as is now for an initial check if SGB or logistic regression or another iterative algorithm will work on some large data set at all. But once the answer looks like "yes" then the algorithm will have to be run normally, one one lonely, hard working processor.

### Telling the Story of Your Stats *Jennifer H. Van Mullekom, Virginia Tech*

Problem: presentations on stats and numbers can be boring.

"Statisticians and data scientists can use storytelling to effectively connect to audiences at all levels to facilitate decision making in the face of uncertainty." If your presentation is boring, people won't pay attention to it - kind of needs to be said. If it's interesting, it'll get into your audience's long term memory - so there is a purpose to telling a story if it helps your audience remember key points. Stories engage system 1, while science and facts engage system 2 from Thinking Fast and Slow. 

For our purposes, story is not fiction or science fiction, but journalism - journalism with checked facts. She recommended an inverted pyramid of journalism as a presentation style. It basically follows this format allowing different audiences to digest at the level they need to.

IMRAD (Introduction, Methods, Results, Analysis, Discussion) makes a boring story structure presentations (Had a chance to see that hold true a few more times this conference). Instead she recommends start with a theme, or "Problem, Causes, Solution" as I've somewhat done here for each talk. A third more interesting structure would be "And, But, Therefore" which she contrasts with "And, And, And..." of facts, which I'm guilty of. And a fourth would be to structure a story with messages. 


She presented some tools to encourage engagement. To go even further away from facts towards interestingness, one can add some "ization" as in dramatization, personalization, emotionalization, or fictionalization. 

She brought up a few story genres one could couch their presentation in. These included:
* Fairy Tale/Fable/Folk Tale
* Why? Or Porquoi
* Quest
* Origin Stories
* Failure Stories
* Behind the Scenes
* Team Stories

A third engagement tool she recommends is making statistics relatable with ADEPT framework:

ADEPT Methodology
* **A**nalogy: Tell me what it's like.
* **D**iagram: Help me visualize it.
* **E**xample: Allow me to experience it.
* **P**lain English: Describe it with everyday language.
* **T**echnical Definition: Discuss the formal details.

In one sense, this all seems obvious and unnecessary to say. On the other hand, I know I need to implement all of these things more, and the presenters at conferences like these very often do as well. It's harder for me to get their message that they've done awesome work when it's in an unrelateable boring IMRAD presentation. I do wonder though if story can become distracting. It can look like it's covering up content. But when both are there, it *is* a treat.
