## 11:00 AM Streamlining Your Work Using Apps

### Mechanizing Clinical Review Processes with R Shiny for Efficiency and Standardization *Jimmy Wong, Food and Drug Administration*

Problem: FDA statisticians build awesome graphics sometimes other statisticians would like to use, but there is no standardized language, so everything looks a little different.

Shiny used here as a tool-creation device to create temporary tools quickly to solve problems efficiently. Shiny apps are for long, complex code, while docs are for a few visualizations or tables.

To communicate what is available, he started a Shiny wiki with what they have. Cool communication around this work. I like this sense of using these things to develop a strong company work group. They approached communication around the change in two levels: Orally and In Writing.

Orally
* Shiny users group
* FDA town halls
* FDA internal conferences
* External conferences (such as CSP)

In Writing
* Shiny wiki
* OB quarterly newsletters
* FDA daily announcements
* Code documentation

While nothing new, under lessons learned he mentioned "less is more" and it struck me maybe that is true when dealing with change, with new approaches to old problems. Present less. I think there's risk it'll be underestimated, though. But the idea is to avoid intimidating jargon and get people interested.


### Building Shiny Apps: With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility *Jessica Minnier, Oregon Health & Science University*

Problem: Experts at their field may not be experts at summarizing their data in meaningful ways. They want to share / distribute their hard work / data, in an easily digestible way.

Shiny apps are exciting because really empower people to look at their data. For example a data journalism app to look at analysis. Or get people to use a new package. Can also be used to QA data:

Hover-over is popular. Dropdown box allows choosing which field is which for imported data. Build error to be clear when not following instructions. Can also make pictures on how needs to look. Shiny landing page is key - [shinyLP can help](https://github.com/jasdumas/shinyLP). Instructions are important and ClustViz's documentation "obviously took a long time".

browser(), print() everything to debug R. testthat, shinytest for unit testing. For speed: Rprofiler in Rstudio is most useful,  and for  asynch programming, future and promises can help. 

Her slides had a lot of detail. [Slides](http://jminnier-talks.netlify.com/2018_02_shiny_csp/minnier_csp2018#1) and [code](https://github.com/jminnier/talks_etc) are available.
