As a former goalie myself, watching the NHL playoffs, curiousity grew about who are these goalies who are so much better than me I'm not in the NHL but they are? Who's a hero, and who's maybe not a keeper? 

What better way to understand how they shake out than clustering their regular season statisitcs? This is an opportunity to work with [tibbleColumns](https://github.com/nhemerson/tibbleColumns) by Hoyt Emerson, a new package that adds some intriguing functionality to dplyr, and [dendextend](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dendextend) by Tal Gallili, which adds options to heirarchical clustering diagrams. Best data I found came from Rob Vollman at [http://www.hockeyabstract.com/testimonials](http://www.hockeyabstract.com/testimonials).

## 1. Loading data

What's the data from hockeyabstract look like? Let's load some packages we'll be using in this analysis and take an initial glimpse.

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(dbscan)
devtools::install_github("nhemerson/tibbleColumns") # requires new-ish version of R
library(tibbleColumns)
library(GGally)
library(broom)
library(naniar)
library(ggfortify)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(scales)
library(dendextend)
library(viridis)

goalies <- read_excel('NHL Goalies 2017-18.xls', sheet = 'Goalies')
glimpse(goalies)

![goalies_02](/images/goalies_02.PNG)

At 95, fewer players than variables! Can see the first column is just rownumber, so remove it. Then take a look look at the distribution of games.

```r
goalies <- goalies[ , -1]

ggplot(goalies, aes(x = GP)) + 
  geom_histogram()

goalies %>% 
  filter(GP >= 35) %>% 
  tbl_out('starters') %>% 
  count()

goalies <- goalies[ , -1]


# take a look at distribution of games

ggplot(goalies, aes(x = GP)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```
![goalies_03](/images/goalies_03.png)

Some at low numbers, and a bit fewer as the number of games played goes up.


```r
goalies %>% 
  filter(GP >= 35) %>% 
  tbl_out('starters') %>% 
  count()
  
starters %>% 
  group_by(`Team(s)`) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
  
starters %>% 
  group_by(`Team(s)`) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  filter(n == 2) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  left_join(starters, by = 'Team(s)') %>% 
  select(`Team(s)`, `First Name`, `Last Name`)
# don't see any dupes

# make sure no dupes in general
goalies %>% 
  group_by(`Last Name`, `First Name`) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) 
```
